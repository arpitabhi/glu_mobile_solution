# Problem 1: Describe the web flow (as much detail as possible) until the page load is complete when an user enters the following url into the browsers: https://www.amazon.com/Hamilton-Beach-49980A-Programmable-Stainless/dp/B00EI7DPPI

# Solution:
    Below is the sequence of steps that will occur.
        1. User Enter the URL in the client/Browerser.
        2. Browsers sends the web address to the local DNS Server.
        3. If the local DNS Server is unavailable it will hit the next DNS Server up the hierarchy.
        4. DNS returns an IP or a Group of shuffled IPs corresponding to the URL.
        5. Brower hits the IP in waterfall fashion untill the IP responds.
        6. The IP would corresponds to the IP of the Load Balancer or a Proxy Server or a Gateway.
        7. Considering it to be a fresh request the load Balancer routes that particular request to a specific application server.
        9. Application server check the API endpint and then fetch the product details from the DB server.
        10. Application server catering to the request will process the information and sends back to client.
        11. Any blob data such as Image or Video would be delivered in the form of a CDN URL.
        12. Client will hit this CDN URL to get the specific Image or Video.

# Describe what might be the cause(s) if the followings happen when the action above is taken:
1.  The browser tries to load the page but is not able to complete in 5 minutes or more.

# Solution:
    There can be multiple reasons for such a slow response.
        1. Absence of Pagination: Data to be fetch is large and requires pagination to be implimented.
        2. Request overload : The Application server might be overwhelmed by the number of request incoming.
        3. Overloaded Flash Memory: The Application servers RAM might be overwhelmed and results in a hung response.
        4. Inadequet Caching: As the size of the data to be catered to coule be in MBs. There needs to be distinction 
        while serving the Blob data. Such a Data needs to be served by a much faster Memory and nearer location which means a CDN is to be used.

2.  The page is not found.
# Solution:
    There can be below reasons for such a response.
        1. The Server responsible for the response is not running or is down.
        2. The API Endpoint is invalid.
        3. The HTML page which caters to that particular request is missing.
        4. Absence of redirects


It would be great if you can tell us how you would find out the cause, or what tools you would use to find out the causes.
# Solution:
    For Slow Response:
        1. I would first check for any dataset fetch or absence of pagination in such a scenario.
        2. I would inspects the Servers RAM usage when such a request comes.
        3. I would running performance testing or load testing to check the performance.
        4. If there is any Image or Blob Data that needs to be catered are served from the primary storage than would
            suggest to make use of CDN depending on the cost viability.
    
    For Page not found:
        1. I would check if the Endpoint given is correct.
        2. Check if the particular html page is not misplaced.
        3. I would check if proper redirects are implimented or not.
